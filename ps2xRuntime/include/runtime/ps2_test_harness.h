// Test and replay support, driven from guest vblanks so that runs are reproducible (use with
// RT_TIME=virtual):
//  - Pad input reaches the game only at vblank boundaries. Each vblank takes the next state from a
//    movie (RT_MOVIE_PLAY), a script (RT_INPUT_SCRIPT, times in seconds of guest time), the test
//    server, or the host's live input, in that order.
//  - RT_MOVIE_RECORD=<file> records the pad state the game saw, one line per change.
//  - RT_STATE_HASH=<file> logs hashes of guest memory every RT_STATE_HASH_INTERVAL vblanks
//    (default 60), to compare runs for determinism.
//  - RT_EXIT_AT_VBLANK=<n> stops the game after n vblanks.
//
// Movie format (text), version 2: "# roadtrip-movie 2" header, then "<vblank> <port> <buttons hex> <lx> <ly>
// <rx> <ry>" whenever a port's state changes, "# connect <vblank> <port> 0|1" when a pad is unplugged or
// plugged in, "# marker <vblank> <kind> <text>" lines, and "# end <vblank>". Version 1 movies (no port
// column) drive both ports with the same state. Buttons are active-low DualShock bits (0xFFFF = nothing
// pressed); sticks are 0..255 with 128 centred.
